# Gesture-Recognition
# Gesture Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a **Gesture Recognition** system using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to recognize different hand gestures (or other body movements) and interpret them for various applications like controlling devices, gaming, or accessibility.

## Introduction
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

For this project, the dataset is loaded and preprocessed as follows:
- Generator Function was used.
- Normalization and resizing of images.
- Model was built with LSTM with Adam Optimizer
- Accuracy of model 93.30% and val accuracy of  86.60%

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- convolution 3D
- LSTM,GRU
- Imageio (for video/image processing)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
